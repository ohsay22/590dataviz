# Energy Transition Analysis in the United States

## Overview

This project, developed by David Osei-Tutu and Ahmadou Bamba Diouf, aims to analyze the transition from traditional to renewable energy sources across different states in the U.S. over time. We focus on understanding the historical consumption patterns of various energy sources, including coal, petroleum, natural gas, and renewables like geothermal and hydropower, to inform future energy policies.

## Objective

The primary objective is to provide data-driven insights into the shift towards renewable energy, identifying leaders and laggards in this transition and understanding the factors driving these changes. Our analysis supports the development of policies that encourage the use of eco-friendly and renewable energy sources.

## Methodology

Our study leverages state-level energy-related data, focusing on:
- **Consumption patterns** of different energy types.
- **Trend analysis** over several years to observe shifts in energy usage.
- **Comparative analysis** to identify differences in renewable energy adoption across states.

We utilize Python for data manipulation and visualization, employing libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express to create interactive graphs and heatmaps for a comprehensive analysis.

## Findings

- A notable decline in coal consumption post-2008, aligning with global trends towards cleaner energy alternatives.
- A consistent use of petroleum, highlighting its integral role despite the energy transition.
- An acceleration in renewable energy adoption in recent years, with variations across states influenced by policies, geographical conditions, and market maturity.

## Conclusions

Our analysis reveals a gradual but positive shift towards renewable energy sources. However, the transition pace varies significantly across states, indicating the need for targeted policy interventions and investment in renewable energy infrastructure to accelerate this shift.
